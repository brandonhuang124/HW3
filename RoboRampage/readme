ORIGINAL LOW BAR GOALS:
- The player will be able to control a character which can move, attack, or reload. [COMPLETE]
- The player and all enemies will not be able to move anywhere on the map, and are constrained to tiles which aren't
walls [COMPLETE]
- When the player begins an attack, an icon will appear showing the direction of the attack which the player can move to
change the direction of the attack [COMPLETE]
- A system will exist which tracks the players health and ammo count visibly on the screen. [COMPLETE]
- Two enemies will be implemented both of which can move and attack. One will attack the player from adjacent tiles and
one will be able to attack the player with a projectile as long as there is a direct line to the player [COMPLETE]
- The enemies will use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route to the player, and will use this route whenever
they move to the player [COMPLETE]
- The game will consist of several levels which will progress in difficulty that the player will have to beat by
defeating all the enemies on the board. [COMPLETE]

OTHER GOALS ACCOMPLISHED:
- Two powerup/pickups were added to the game, one which heals the player and one which gives them a new weapon that does
increased damage and pierces through enemies.
- One stage hazard that damages the player if they end their turn on it was implemented in the form of an acid pool.
- Animated assets were implemented for the player and enemies for a more complete look.
- An endless mode was added to the game, where enemies continually spawn from 3 spawn points and the player has to try
to stay alive for as long as possible.

Tips:
  Level 5 is hard but beatable. If you need a hint, go for the beam weapon. :)
